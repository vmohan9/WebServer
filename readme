A web server makes a great pretense for a backdoor, because web traffic is so prevalent it does not raise red flags and ports 80 and 443 are frequently permitted through firewalls.
This is a minimal HTTP 1.1 server, based on RFC 2616 from scratch, without using any HTTP libraries.

Webserver program implementation:
Command : ./normal_web_server portnumber

Used socket programming and multithreading concepts.

1)Establised a socket connection between the server and client browser
2)Extracted the command after http://localhost:portno/exec/
3)Executed the command using subprocess.Popen()
4)If the request was not in the specified format, sent an HTTP 404 response
4)Sent the appropriate HTTP response and the result to the client
5)Handled SIGINT signal
6)Sent the gzipped content to the browser by setting the appropriate headers for gzip encoding
